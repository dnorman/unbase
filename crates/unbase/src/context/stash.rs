/// # What is a Stash?
/// Stash is very important to the operation of unbase - It is the beating heart of its consistency model.
///
/// A Stash is a special set containing [`Head`](crate::head::Head) and their Edges which must be
/// considered for state projection. It assumes that Heads which are put into it have a *heirarchical*
/// relationship with each other. Even if that heirarchy isn't fully represented in the Stash, it must exist, and of
/// course be free of cycles.
///
/// Because each unbase node (Slab) may relocate data with other peers, it may not have sufficient data locally to
/// project state consistently when a given value is requested later. By itself, this would be way worse than eventual
/// consistency, because one minute it would be consistent, and the next it would lose edits you just made on the same
/// node. Worse still, it may never reconverge!
///
/// Most systems use a total order, or sharding (or both) to achieve consistency â€“ but the express goal of unbase is to
/// NOT do that. Instead, we use the Stash during the projection process to make sure we have a monotonic view of the
/// world. We may not have all The data, but at least we'll know when we're missing something, and that's useful.
///
/// So, whenever we write data into the system, it must be copied to the stash, otherwise we might forget! Similarly,
/// whenever we read data from the system, we must consult the stash to make sure we're considering all the data we
/// should. Easy peasy, right?
///
/// # Stash Compaction
/// Well, there's a bit of a downside to writing all edits into the stash: It'll fill up and get huge! If we kept all
/// this data, it would be at least the same size as a full log of all edits ever made. That's no good! We want the
/// stash to be as compact as possible. But how do we do that if we're always putting stuff into it? This is actually a
/// very common design pattern. It's called an immutable/persistent data structure. You build a b-tree, and when you
/// write a record, you create a new copy of the leaf pointing to that record, and the parent node pointing to that, and
/// so on up to the root node. The whole thing is beautifully immutable, *except* for the *one* mutable reference to the
/// root node. That root node is your "Stash"
///
/// Unfortunately if we try to implement unbase this way, we'll have an explosion of traffic! Remember, we have to play
/// nicely with others. How do we merge those edits? We would have to send each other N+1 write operations (where N is
/// the depth of the B-tree) for each edit. And then we'd have to emit new edits for each of those containing the merged
/// versions of the B-tree nodes, and and then we're have to repeat the process for other edits we receive from other
/// nodes, and so on. It's a runaway cascade, commonly referred to as "Write amplification", and it's very bad.
///
/// So what can we do instead? Well, much like an immutable/persistent data structure, each edit generates a new leaf
/// node of the B-tree, and that gets put into the stash. But we don't immediately generate new parent B-tree nodes. We
/// let it simmer a bit. Whereas the "Stash" for an immutable/persistent data structure is a set of exactly *one*
/// mutable reference to the root node, our Stash is a set of *N* mutable references to different non-root (plus exactly
/// one root) B-tree nodes. We have to add new nodes whenever we do an edit, but periodically we can issue new non-leaf
/// B-tree nodes which reference one (or ideally more) leaf nodes which were in the stash. We also do this for non-leaf
/// parents, and so on, all the way up to the root node, but the frequency of our doing so drops precipitously as we get
/// closer to the root node.
///
/// *Crucially* because we put the new non-leaf node in the stash, we can remove those which it points to!
/// We can do this because we know that the B-tree must be traversed to locate the record, and the nodes we removed from
/// the stash will be considered _vicariously_ because we kept the parent node pointing to them. As such a Stash
/// automatically prunes Heads which are descended-by-or-equal-to *any* of the Edges of any Head inserted
/// into the stash.
