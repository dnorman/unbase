//! **unbase** is a causal, coordination-free distributed data-persistence and application framework.
//! It is fundamentally reactive, fault tolerant, and decentralized.
//! It could be thought of as a peer-to-peer database with a causal consistency model,
//! stored procedures and triggers, content-filtered pubsub built in. When Unbase is ready for
//! production use, it should be usable as an application framework, distributing busines logic
//! all around the network as needed.
//!
//! The unbase design entails no server/client distinctions, no masters, no quorums, no DHT, and maximum
//! consistency with human causal expectation. We reject the notion that consistency requires
//! serializability. Orchestration of physical reality doesn't entail centralized arbiters, and
//! neither should our systems.
//!
//! Unbase is presently pre-alpha, and should not yet be used for anything serious.
//! See [unba.se](https://unba.se)for details.
//!
//! - [`Network`](./network/struct.Network.html) Represents an unbase system
//!
//! - [`Slab`](./slab/struct.Slab.html) Storage for constituent elements of the unbase data model:
//! Memos, MemoRefs, and SlabRefs.
//!
//! - [`Context`](./context/struct.Context.html) Enforces the consistency model, allows for queries
//! to be executed
//!
//! - [`Subject`](./subject/struct.Subject.html) Conceptually similar to an Object, or an RDBMS
//! record. Rather than storing state, state is projected as needed to satisfy user queries.
//!
//! ```
//! let net     = unbase::Network::create_new_system(); // typically use new here instead
//! let slab    = unbase::Slab::new(&net);
//! let context = slab.create_context();
//!
//! let record  = unbase::Subject::new_kv(&context, "animal_type","Cat").unwrap();
//! let record2 = context.get_subject_by_id(record.id).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!(record.get_value("animal_type"), record2.get_value("animal_type"));
//! ```
